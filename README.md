# elf-shift
Creating an automatic elf-shifting platform for the Berkeley Forum

This is meant to run locally on your computer. Run app.py to launch the website and visit the link it gives you. Then give the three CSV's in the mainCSV folder to the website and it will output shifts.
The baseTime folder is meant to generate all the avaliable times people have from the Google Form at the beginning of the year. The event manager can copy over the times to the availableTimes CSV.
